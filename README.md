# meetup_foodie

A budgeting app for catering food for meetups

##Project Proposal

###Phase 0 - basic ui  
Create a ui that only function is to total onscreen elements, purely static  
and once loaded the ui does not change. Item name and price are stored in  
code.

###Phase 1 - Adding Interactivity   
Values are still stored in code, ui has dropdowns for quantity and submit  
button processes total.

###Phase 2 - Reading from Files and Adding Images  
Ui will evolve from basic form and adds images and quantity +/-. Also the image
src are loaded from DB or file or web to populate UI.

###Phase 3 -  Second Screen  
Once you submit total screen is redrawn with a Shopping List of selected  
items and total amount of money spent.

###Phase 4 - Making it Convenient  
Adds a Intro Screen to select a restaurant. When you are getting food for  
meetup you don't want to go to different places. So the intro screen groups  
items by locations. The file or DB will need to be changed as well. So the  
user selects a restaurant and then only those food items will be shown on  
second screen. You can still include like a supermarket category along with  
restaurant if so desired.
